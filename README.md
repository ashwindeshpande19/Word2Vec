Used the pre-trained embeddings file to compute the 20 most similar words using cosine

a. life  

b. market 

c. Stanford 

Visualization  
a. Created a t-sne visualization, displaying first 1000 words in the file.  
b. Used t-sne visualization to display the nearest 20 words for a given word. Create a separate 
visualization of all the 3 words above, where each visualization displays the nearest 
20 words for a word. 


The above words can be replaced by any other words that are present in the file.
